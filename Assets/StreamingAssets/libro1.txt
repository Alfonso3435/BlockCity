<b><size=50>Basics of Cryptography</size></b>
------------------------------------------------------------

<size=36><i>What is cryptography?<i></size>

<size=20>It is the practice of protecting communication so that only authorized people can read the messages.</size>

---

<size=28><i>Simple example: Word inversion</i></size>
<size=20>
The word "crypto" â†’ "otpYrc"
(Easy to decipher, but illustrates how data is transformed).
</size>

---

<size=28><i>SHA-256: Real security</i></size></b>

<size=20>
Hash algorithm that converts any text into a long string of numbers and letters.

Once generated, it cannot be reversed to the original message.

Protecting information with SHA-256 is so secure that decrypting it would take thousands of times the age of the Earth.

<size=28><i>Conclusion:</i></size>

<size=20>
Cryptography allows secure communications and protects information from attacks.

<b><size=50>What's Inside a Blockchain and the Crypto-Economy</size></b>

<size=36><i>Whatâ€™s inside a blockchain?</i></size>

---

<size=28><i>The blockchain itself</i></size>

<size=20> Itâ€™s a transaction ledger where all operations are recorded. Each block in the chain contains:

Nonce: A random number that helps validate the block.

Hash of the previous block: What links the blocks together.

List of transactions: Validated data inside the block.

Hash of the current block: Unique identification of the block.

This way, each block is connected to the previous one, forming a secure and immutable chain. </size>

---

<size=28><i>The role of miners</i></size>

<size=20> Miners validate transactions and build new blocks in the blockchain through a process called Proof of Work (PoW).

Their goal is to solve a math puzzle known as the miner's riddle, which involves:

Taking the hash of the previous block.

Combining it with a number (nonce).

Passing it through the SHA-256 algorithm.

Finding a hash that begins with a certain number of zeros.

This process is trial and error, requiring a lot of computing power. </size>

---

<size=28><i>Minersâ€™ reward</i></size>

<size=20> Miners earn 6.25 Bitcoin + transaction fees for each validated block.

As the 21 million Bitcoin limit is reached, fees will become the main incentive to keep mining. </size>

---

<size=28><i>Automatic system regulation</i></size>

<size=20> The system adjusts difficulty depending on the number of miners:

If there are many miners, difficulty increases.

If there are few, it decreases.

The goal is to keep the pace of 1 block every 10 minutes. </size>

---

<size=28><i>Blockchain-based business models</i></size>

<size=20>

Mining: Validating blocks to earn rewards.

Trading: Buying and selling cryptocurrencies to profit from volatility.

Investing: Buying and holding valuable cryptocurrencies.

Exchanges: Platforms to buy, sell, and convert crypto assets.

Crowdfunding: Creating and selling tokens or personal cryptocurrencies.

NFT Games: Unique blockchain objects to trade in games.

<size=28><i>Todayâ€™s recap:</i></size>

<size=20> 
-> What a blockchain is and how it works.
-> The role of miners and Proof of Work.
-> How mining difficulty is adjusted.
-> Key business models in the blockchain world.

Blockchain isnâ€™t just about cryptocurrencies â€” itâ€™s a tech revolution! ðŸš€ </size>
