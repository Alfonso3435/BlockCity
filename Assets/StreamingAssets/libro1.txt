<size=55><b>Basics of Cryptography</b></size>

<size=50>
<i><b>What is cryptography?</b></i> 
It is the practice of protecting communication so that only authorized people can read the messages.

<i><b>Simple example: Word reversal</b></i> 
The word "crypto" → "otpYrc" (Easy to decipher, but illustrates how data is transformed).

<i><b>SHA-256: Real security</b></i> 
    -> A hash algorithm that converts any text into a long string of numbers and letters.
    -> Once generated, it cannot be reversed to the original message.
    -> Protecting information with SHA-256 is so secure that deciphering it would take thousands of times the age of the Earth.

<i><b>Conclusion:</b></i> 
Cryptography enables secure communications and protects information from attacks.

<size=55><b>What's Inside a Blockchain and the Crypto-Economy</b></size>

<size=50>
<i><b>What is inside a blockchain</b></i>
    The blockchain itself is a ledger of transactions where all operations are recorded. Each block in the chain contains:
        -> Nonce: A random number that helps validate the block.
        -> Hash of the previous block: What links the blocks in the chain.
        -> List of transactions: Validated data within the block.
        -> Hash of the current block: Unique identification of the block.
    Thus, each block is connected to the previous one, forming a secure and immutable chain.

<i><b>The role of miners</b></i>
    Miners validate transactions and build new blocks in the blockchain through a process called Proof of Work (PoW). Their goal is to solve a mathematical puzzle called the miner's riddle, which consists of:
        1. Taking the hash of the previous block.
        2. Combining it with a number (nonce).
        3. Passing it through the SHA-256 algorithm.
        4. Finding a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros. This process is based on trial and error, requiring a lot of computational power.

<i><b>Reward for miners</b></i>
    Miners receive 6.25 Bitcoin + transaction fees for each validated block. 
    As the limit of 21 million Bitcoins is reached, fees will be the main incentive to continue mining.

<i><b>Automatic regulation of the system</b></i>
    The system adjusts the difficulty according to the number of miners. 
    If there are many miners, the difficulty increases; if there are few, it decreases. The goal is to maintain a rate of 1 block every 10 minutes.

<i><b>Business models based on blockchain</b></i>
    -> Mining: Validating blocks to earn rewards.
    -> Trading: Buying and selling cryptocurrencies to take advantage of their volatility.
    -> Investment: Buying and holding cryptocurrencies with high historical value.
    -> Exchange: Platforms for buying, selling, and converting crypto assets.
    -> Crowdfunding: Creating and selling your own tokens or cryptocurrencies.
    -> NFT Games: Creating unique items on the blockchain to trade in games.

<i><b>Summary of today</b></i>
    -> What a blockchain is and how it works.
    -> The role of miners and Proof of Work.
    -> How mining difficulties are regulated.
    -> Main business models in blockchain.

Blockchain is not just cryptocurrencies; it is a technological revolution!

<b><size=55>What is cryptocurrency? What is a wallet?</size></b>

<size=50>
<i><b>1. Concept of Blockchain and Transactions</b></i>
    -> Blockchain is a distributed ledger that securely and transparently stores transactions.  
    -> Addresses in blockchain are generated through cryptography and show the origin and destination of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.  
    -> Each transaction is recorded in the blockchain in an immutable manner.  

<i><b>2. Cryptocurrencies and Their Use</b></i>
    -> A cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money.  
    -> It is not issued or controlled by any central entity, allowing for peer-to-peer exchanges without intermediaries.  
    -> It can be used anywhere in the world without banking restrictions, facilitating fast and economical transfers.  

<i><b>3. Advantages of Blockchain Technology</b></i>
    -> Security: Based on cryptography and distributed consensus.  
    -> Transparency: All transactions are visible on the blockchain.  
    -> Accessibility: Anyone with internet access can use cryptocurrencies.  
    -> Independence: It does not depend on traditional financial institutions.  

<i><b>4. Bitcoin and the Mining Process</b></i>  
    -> Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency, created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto.  
    -> Its issuance is limited to 21 million coins.  
    -> Mining is the process by which transactions are validated and blocks are added to the blockchain.  
    -> It uses the "Proof of Work" consensus mechanism, which requires solving complex cryptographic problems.  
    -> Mining consumes large amounts of energy, but it is still less than that of the traditional banking system.  

<i><b>5. Proof of Stake as an Alternative</b></i>  
    -> Ethereum, a popular blockchain, uses "Proof of Stake" instead of "Proof of Work."  
    -> In this model, validators stake a certain amount of cryptocurrency to verify transactions.  
    -> If they act dishonestly, they can lose their staked funds.  
    -> It consumes up to 99% less energy compared to Proof of Work.  

<i><b>6. How a Transaction Works in Ethereum</b></i>  
    -> A user initiates a transaction (e.g., sending funds to another user).  
    -> The transaction is sent to the "mempool" to be validated.  
    -> Validators check the legitimacy of the transaction and add it to a block.  
    -> The transaction is confirmed and reflected on the blockchain.  
    -> "Gas" fees are paid to prioritize transactions based on network congestion.  

<i><b>7. Ethereum and Its Ecosystem</b></i>  
    -> Ethereum allows the creation of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts.  
    -> It is a platform that supports the development of new projects in Web3.  
    -> Its blockchain not only facilitates cryptocurrency transactions but also the execution of code within smart contracts.  

<i><b>8. Connecting to the Blockchain through Wallets</b></i>  
    -> To interact with the blockchain, users need a wallet (digital wallet).  
    -> Wallets store private keys, which allow access and control over funds.  
    -> A private key is essential for security, as losing it means losing access to the funds.
