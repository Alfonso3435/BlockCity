<size=50><b>Basics of Cryptography</b>

<i><b>What is cryptography?</b></i> 
It is the practice of protecting communication so that only authorized people can read the messages.

<i><b>Simple example: Word reversal</b></i> 
The word "crypto" → "otpYrc" (Easy to decipher, but illustrates how data is transformed).

<i><b>SHA-256: Real security</b></i> 
-> A hash algorithm that converts any text into a long string of numbers and letters.

-> Once generated, it cannot be reversed to the original message.

-> Protecting information with SHA-256 is so secure that deciphering it would take thousands of times the age of the Earth.

<i><b>Conclusion:</b></i> 
Cryptography enables secure communications and protects information from attacks. </size>

<size=50><b>What's Inside a Blockchain and the Crypto-Economy</b>

<i><b>What is inside a blockchain</b></i>
    The blockchain itself is a ledger of transactions where all operations are recorded. Each block in the chain contains:
        -> Nonce: A random number that helps validate the block.
        -> Hash of the previous block: What links the blocks in the chain.
        -> List of transactions: Validated data within the block.
        -> Hash of the current block: Unique identification of the block.
 Thus, each block is connected to the previous one, forming a secure and immutable chain.

<i><b>The role of miners</b></i>
    Miners validate transactions and build new blocks in the blockchain through a process called Proof of Work (PoW). Their goal is to solve a mathematical puzzle called the miner's riddle, which consists of:
        1. Taking the hash of the previous block.
        2. Combining it with a number (nonce).
        3. Passing it through the SHA-256 algorithm.
        4. Finding a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros. This process is based on trial and error, requiring a lot of computational power.

<i><b>Reward for miners</b></i>
    Miners receive 6.25 Bitcoin + transaction fees for each validated block. 
    As the limit of 21 million Bitcoins is reached, fees will be the main incentive to continue mining.

<i><b>Automatic regulation of the system</b></i>
    The system adjusts the difficulty according to the number of miners. 
    If there are many miners, the difficulty increases; if there are few, it decreases. The goal is to maintain a rate of 1 block every 10 minutes.

<i><b>Business models based on blockchain</b></i>
    -> Mining: Validating blocks to earn rewards.
    -> Trading: Buying and selling cryptocurrencies to take advantage of their volatility.
    -> Investment: Buying and holding cryptocurrencies with high historical value.
    -> Exchange: Platforms for buying, selling, and converting crypto assets.
    -> Crowdfunding: Creating and selling your own tokens or cryptocurrencies.
    -> NFT Games: Creating unique items on the blockchain to trade in games.

 <i><b>Summary of today</b></i>
 -> What a blockchain is and how it works.
 -> The role of miners and Proof of Work.
 -> How mining difficulties are regulated.
 -> Main business models in blockchain.

Blockchain is not just cryptocurrencies; it is a technological revolution!
